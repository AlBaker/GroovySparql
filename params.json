SPARQL endpoints such as DBPedia - the project that offers Wikipedia data as a structured set of semantic services - are everywhere. One of the motivations for this project is to be able to write small Groovy programs that use Grapes and grab the Groovy SPARQL jar, and start writing queries and iterating over results.\r\n\r\nThe design is straight forward - provide idiomatic Groovy APIs over Apache Jena, and where possible provide a simple and framework agnostic view of a SPARQL endpoint. GroovySparql is based on Apache Jena, and there are hooks to use Jena specific APIs, but in general a user can use GroovySparql without knowing anything of Jena.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
